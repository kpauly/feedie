Feedie is a native Windows application that scans SD-card dump folders from your wildlife feeder camera, detects visitors with an EfficientViT model, and helps you export curated images and CSV reports. Everything runs fast on CPU only and locally — no cloud upload unless you explicitly opt in to sharing samples with Roboflow. The entire app is targeted to non-tech savvy users, and only available in Dutch for the moment. Additional languages (starting with English) are planned. The embedded model currently targets common garden species in Belgium and the Netherlands. Releases for other Operating Systems are also planned.

## Background and motivation

Feedie was born out of a need for a simple, efficient, and user-friendly tool to manage low-end bird feeder camera data such as the [Denver bird feeder camera](https://denvershop.nl/products/denver-bfc1200?variant=51259653095755) that typically come without software. Hence, the initial motivation was to create a solution that could identify and sort the large volumes of images generated by these cameras on a simple laptop with CPU only, originally targeted to non-technical users in Belgium and The Netherlands. Existing open-source tools like [AddaxAI](https://addaxdatascience.com/addaxai/) are not available in Dutch, make model selection too technical, and do not have adequate models that deal with the characteristic species and close-up front view perspective of bird feeder cameras. Aditionally, APIs that connect to potentially capable classification models such as [Naturalis AI Nature](https://ainature.eu/), the model behind observation.org (waarnemingen.be/waarneming.nl), do not yet offer plans that are affordable for non-commercial end users and allow occasional bulk inference, and would still take a considerable time to run inference. In line with lean requirements, compared to AddaxAI Feedie uses 10 times less RAM memory both in idle and during processing, processes images 75 times faster (and 15 time faster compared to the AI Nature API), and requires 400 times less model storage and runtime space. In developing a solution to deal with these issues, this project was also meant to learn something about recent programming languages and concepts, such as spec-driven agentic coding in Rust and Candle to achieve a native solution, and software release and maintenance.

## Features

- **EfficientViT inference** – Runs the bundled EfficientViT-M0 weights on CPU with configurable thresholds and background classes.
- **Smart galleries** – Tabs for `Aanwezig`, `Leeg`, and `Onzeker` so you can triage detections quickly.
- **Context menu actions** – Assign species, mark background, or create new labels on batches of thumbnails.
- **Export workflows** – Per-selection export via context menu or batch export from the dedicated tab (species folders, Onzeker bundle, Leeg bundle, CSV with metadata). The CSV file format is compatible with [Observation.org](https://observation.org/) (waarnemingen.be/waarneming.nl) for bulk import.
- **Model updater** – Checks `manifest.json`, shows available app/model versions, and can download/install new models automatically into `%AppData%\Feedie\models`.
- **Roboflow opt-in uploader** – When enabled, manual relabels are uploaded in the background without blocking the UI. This enables regular model improvements through community contributions.

- `crates/app_gui`: Uses `eframe/egui` for the Windows UI, handles scanning, manifest fetching, and model download/installation.
- `crates/feeder_core`: Library with `scan_folder_with`, `EfficientVitClassifier`, and export helpers, reusable in other tools.

## Download & install

1. Grab the latest `FeedieSetup.exe` from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/kpauly/feeder-vision/releases).
2. Run the installer (administrator privileges required). Feedie is installed to `C:\Program Files\Feedie`.
3. Launch Feedie from the Start menu. The bundled model is copied to `%AppData%\Feedie\models` on first run so you can work offline immediately.

> Prefer a portable build? Run `cargo build --release -p app_gui` and start `target\release\Feedie.exe`.

---

## Using Feedie

1. **Fotomap tab** – Point Feedie at your feeder cam SD-card dump folder. It shows how many frames were found and lets you start a scan.
2. **Scanresultaat tab** – Review `Aanwezig`, `Leeg`, and `Onzeker` galleries. Use the context menu for quick relabels, export of selected images, or double-click to open the preview window.
3. **Exporteren tab** – Choose what to export:
   - Species with confident detections (creates subfolders per species)
   - All `Onzeker` samples (single `Onzeker` folder)
   - All `Leeg` frames (single `Leeg` folder)
   - CSV with date/time/scientific name/lat/lng/path (camera GPS coordinates are prompted once per export). 
4. **Instellingen tab** – Adjust thresholds, enable Roboflow uploads, and manage updates. The section at the bottom shows app/model versions and exposes the “Download en installeren” button when a new model is published.

Documentation in `specs/` covers the product spec, tasks, and test scenarios if you want a deeper dive.

## Model & manifest updates

- `manifest.json` is the lightweight descriptor hosted via GitHub raw. It contains the latest app tag and model release.
- Feedie stores active models in `%AppData%\Feedie\models`, always expecting three files:
  - `feeder-efficientvit-m0.safetensors`
  - `feeder-labels.csv`
  - `model_version.txt`
- When the manifest reports a newer model version, the UI offers a download button. Feedie fetches the ZIP (`Feedie_EfficientViT-m0_vX.Y.Z.zip`), validates the contents, installs them into the AppData directory, refreshes the labels, and updates `model_version.txt`.
- You can also unzip releases manually into `%AppData%\Feedie\models` if you prefer fully offline installs.

If you launch without network access, Feedie keeps using the installed model. Click “Opnieuw controleren” once you reconnect.

## Building from source

Prerequisites:

- Rust toolchain (`rustup` with the MSVC target on Windows)
- Windows 11 build tools (Visual Studio Build Tools or Desktop Development with C++)

Steps:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kpauly/feeder-vision.git
cd feeder-vision
./scripts/ci.ps1       # fmt + clippy + tests
cargo run -p app_gui   # debug build
cargo run --release -p app_gui
```

CI helper scripts:

- `./scripts/ci.ps1` – format + clippy + tests
- `./scripts/spec_check.ps1` – ensures every scenario in `specs/scenarios.md` is referenced by tests

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and feedback! Ideas:

- Improve EfficientViT training (see `models/` + `specs/tasks.md`)
- Polish UI/UX or translations
- Add new export formats or automation scripts
- Build integrations using `feeder_core`

Before submitting a PR:

1. Update specs/tests if your change affects user-facing behavior.
2. Run `./scripts/ci.ps1`.
3. Describe which scenario/task you’re targeting so we can keep specs aligned.

## Acknowledgements

The entire app and documentation is vibe coded using [Zed](https://zed.dev) with the [OpenAI Codex via ACP](https://zed.dev/blog/codex-is-live-in-zed). The openly available classification model training dataset is maintained, labeled and versioned on [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/kp-dsglx/voederhuiscamera). The dataset has an associated proprietary trained model available for inference on Roboflow, but a model for local in-app use was based on EfficientViT-M0 pretrained on Imagenet-1k, available from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/timm/efficientvit_m0.r224_in1k) and fine-tuned on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). It was implemented natively (without requiring an external runtime) using [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) and exposed through [egui/eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui). The Feedie icon was designed from [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). The app installer was built using [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

Happy birding! 🐦📸 If you build something on top of Feedie—new models, workflows, or accessories—we’d love to hear about it.
